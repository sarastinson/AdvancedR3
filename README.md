# AdvancedR3: Reproducible research in R

TODO: Give a brief description of what your project is about

This project is learning reproducible research in R at the advanced
level.

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, doc and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: contains rda for lipidomics
-   `doc/`: contains lessons and reports
-   `R/`: contains functions

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_deps()

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

# Resource

For more information on this folder and file workflow and setup, check

documentation.
